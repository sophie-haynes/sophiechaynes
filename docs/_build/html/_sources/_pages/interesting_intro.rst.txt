Interesting Resources
======================

While browsing the web, I often find cool resources, novel experiments with data and algorithms, and other miscellaneous stuff I don't want to lose. Admittedly, I *could* just bookmark each and call it a day, however I want to do some deep dives into what I find! Make some notes about each, so I don't completely forget what I found and why it's so cool :) 

Link List:
__________

- https://openai.com/resources/ ~ Has a lot of material on *Deep Reinforcement Learning* (you know, the cool deep learning)
- https://github.com/GarrettHoffman/Strata_2018_DL_4_NLP ~ Some DL for NLP material from a paper (note that there's also a neat page linked in the README that discusses RNNs with NLP)
