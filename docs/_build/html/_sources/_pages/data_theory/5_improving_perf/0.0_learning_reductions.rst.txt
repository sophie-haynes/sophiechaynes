Reduction is the process of breaking a complex problem into simpler subproblems,which when solved, resolves the initial complex problem. 

Consider the *one-against-all* reduction, this simplifies a *k*-way multiclass problem to *k* binary problems. While there are more problems, they are simpler to solve.

However, a learning reduction may also produce difficult subproblems, and this should be considered when using this approach.

*"Creating a usable interface which is not computationally constraining is critical to success."*
