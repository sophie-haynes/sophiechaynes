Approach is based on the **"Look and Think Twice"** concept. This paper boasts state of the art performance on COCO test-dev.

It uses a combination of two architectures:

- **Switchable Atrous Convolution (SAC):** On the *micro* level, it looks twice at the 


**Hint** 

-  An *Atrous Convolution* is basically a zoomed out convolution, that maintains the *same dimensions* by only using pixels according to the dilation factor.  
- *Kernel Size* is the FOV of the convolution (typically a 3x3 pixel grid)
- *Stride* is the step size between each conv (usually 1)
- *Padding* adds empty pixels around the image, so that all convolutions have the same dimenions (border conv. aren't missing pixels).
