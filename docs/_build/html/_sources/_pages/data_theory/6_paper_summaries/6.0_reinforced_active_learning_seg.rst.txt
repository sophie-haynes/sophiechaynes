Why Use Active Learning?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Real life datasets are typically heavily imbalanced, so performance will be biased to the most represented
* Active learing helps reduce the amount of labelling required, while focusing only on labelling the data which is actually required by the model
* Paper combines this with *deep reinforcement learning* using a modified *`deep Q-network` formula* to suit large scale segmentation

	✔️  This methodology required 30% less additional labelled data

	✔️  Helped mitigate *class imbalance*
