Data: Natural Language / Unstructured Text ðŸ“–
=============================================

Natural languauge and unstructured text refers to data which textual and is generally organically created (that is, data what was not entered using a form, categorical descriptions etc). In my completely biased opinion, it is one of the most exciting data types to deal with. With other data types, such as numeric, categoric and so on, each data point has a value, and while you can normalise and statistically manipulate it, the intrinsic value does not change. *Natural language* on the other hand carries contextual information as well as deeper meanings that can be extracted out of each word. Additionally, given that every single word can carry value, one must be creative in how the data is managed and manipulated. 

This page aims to outline the basic workflow involved in processing natural language, provide warnings and guidance on some obstacles unique to this data type, and bring attention to some exciting tools and techniques used in tihs field.
